[fastai lesson 1](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1)

1. What is the following codeblock doing? In what environment do you expect to see this kind of code? What is this kind of code called?

```
%reload_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
%matplotlib inline
```

1. What library is FastAI built on top of?
    * TensorFlow
    * OpenAI
    * PyTorch
    * pandas

1. Which of the following applications is _NOT_ supported by FastAI?
    * computer vision
    * natural language text
    * robotics optimization
    * tabular data
    * collaborative filtering

1. Jeremy Howard make a big deal out of `import *`. Why is it usually bad in python coding, and why does he think it is okay in notebooks?
  
1. Jeremy normalizes the image data by making each color channel have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. What do *mean* and *std dev* mean?

1. Describe *transfer learning*. How is it used in the context of lesson 1?

1. What is overfitting? How can we make sure that our models are not overfitted?

1. What is a *validation set* (i.e. *test set*)?

1. True or False: With FastAI, you must always manually create a validation set.

1. True or False: I enjoyed watching the self-promotion portion of the lesson.

1. What is a *loss function* (or *cost function*)?

1. What is a confusion matrix? What does Jeremy recommend instead (when you have many labels)?

1. In a convolutional neural network, are simple features more likely to be recognized in early layers or late layers?

1. What is the difference between ResNet34 and ResNet50? What does that mean for hardware requirements?

1. Did you notice the link to _detailed lesson notes_? It's a pretty great way to follow along.
