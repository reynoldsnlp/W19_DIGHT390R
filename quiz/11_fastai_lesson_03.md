1. What can you use instead?

1. What is a `partial` (functional programming)? How does Jeremy use a partial?

1. What is going on with the dot syntax in the question about the data block pipeline?

1. What is an image segmentation problem? How does it relate to classification? Is it more like single-label or multi-label classification?
