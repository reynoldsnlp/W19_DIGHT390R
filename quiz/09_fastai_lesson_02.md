1. What is a CNN? (*Hint: it's not fake news*)

1. What was your favorite student project that Jeremy talked about?

1. Is Adrian Rosebrock's approach to collecting an image corpus legal?

1. Jeremy talks about whether to seed the random number generator. What is his point?

1. When Jeremy creates the teddy CNN, he gives it the ResNet34 architecture. Why does he do that?

1. What should you look for in the `lr_find()` plot when you try to determine the best learning rate?

1. What characteristics does Jeremy cite as good predictors that a datapoint has an incorrect label?

1. Why does Jeremy recommend using CPUs for inference, and GPUs for training?

1. When you `fit_one_cycle()` and the validation loss is well above 1, what does that mean?

1. How can you tell if your learning rate is too low? (2 things)

1. What is an epoch? How can you tell if you've trained for enough epochs? How do you know if you've done too many epochs?

1. True / False : Having train loss lower than validation loss means you have overfit your model.

1. What does it mean if your error rate begins rising?

1. What does the `argmax` function do?

1. With a partner, derive Jeremy's modified slope-intercept equation from $y = mx + b$. (Try without looking, but if you get stuck go back to the [lecture notes](https://github.com/hiromis/notes/blob/master/Lesson2.md).)

1. What does SGD *really* stand for?

1. What is a tensor? How is an image a tensor?

1. What is tensor rank? What is the rank of an image tensor?

1. What does it mean when a PyTorch method ends with an `_`?

1. What is a regression? What is the relationship between a regression line and a loss function?

1. True / False : The most common loss function is Nominal Extraction of the Bayesian Posterior (NEBP).

1. What is the importance of the learning rate during SGD?

1. What is a (mini-)batch? What does that have to do with the name "SGD"?

1. What is the relation between `epoch`/`batch`/`iteration`?

1. What is the difference between an `architecture` and a `model`?

1. Which of the following does not belong?
    * Functions 
    * Parameters
    * Coefficients
    * Weights

1. How does a validation set protect you from overfit?

1. Are we going too fast?
