#### Wed, 30 Jan

* Finish your toy apertium translation model
   * I should be able to `make` to compile the binaries, and then run `bash tests.sh` and see your output
   * I recommend setting up `tests.sh` the sooner the better. That way you can check your own work and add more test sentences as you go.
